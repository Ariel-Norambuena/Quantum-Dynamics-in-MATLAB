# Quantum-Dynamics-in-MATLAB
In this repository, we release the numerical methods used for the paper https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6404/ab8360. 
The algorithms are used to solve both closed and open dynamics in quantum systems, where the codes are presented in the MATLAB language.
